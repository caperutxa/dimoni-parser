Times
-----
To evaluate the total time (from the beginning to end) the first and the last
row should start with the configured date time format
  --> By default "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS"

To extract the times correctly the log should follow this format:
  [DateTime format] - TIME : [long] #@# [ETimeS] #@# [string description]
Note that the string separators (#@#) are too much important
